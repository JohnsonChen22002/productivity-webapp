3. **Executive summary** (2 paragraphs)
    - This application helps user organize and manage their time better using to-do lists, calenders, goal setting, time tracking for tasks etc (With the Possibility of an AI assitant). We find calender and task tracking apps very useful and almost a necessity when having a busy schedule. Most apps we used were great for a specific aspect of time management but lack or disregard other aspects. This web app would be targeted towards students and other professionals who need to organize their lives. 

    - A summary/pitch of your project. This should include answers to the following:
        + What does the application do?
        + What is the motivation for your application?
        + Which types of people would want to use this application? (don't say everyone)
        + Are there similar applications and/or competitors available now? How does your idea differ? or why is there a need for a competitor?
            * _It is OK for your idea to be a clone of an existing application_
5. **User-types**:
    - Clearly define and describe the User-types for your application. 1 or more user-types depending on your idea.

6. **User Stories**:
    - List the most important actions for each user-type
    - What are the most important workflows for users of your application

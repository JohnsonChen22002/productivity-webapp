3. **Executive summary** (2 paragraphs)
    - This life-focused application will serve as a comprehensive platform that offers a range of features and functionalities to address user's need for organization and time management such as to-do lists, calenders, goal setting, time tracking for tasks, etc. Many individuals struggle with time management, organization, and efficiency in various aspects of their lives. We find these features very useful and almost a necessity when having a busy schedule. Most apps we used were great for a specific aspect of time management but lack or disregard other aspects. This web app would be targeted towards students who want to manage their academic schedules, assignments, and study materials more effectively and other professionals who seek tools to improve productivity and manage their work efficiently.
    - There are several applications and/or competitors available that offer features and functionalities similar to the we are envisioning. However, imagine having everything you need and want for your life journey all in one place. No more juggling between different websites or apps that offer only one or a few of these essential features. Our platform brings together all these features with comprehensive solution for all their needs under a single, user-friendly roof.
